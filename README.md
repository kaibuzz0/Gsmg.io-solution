## 📜 Introduction

This repository contains the **complete decryption path** and **solution** to the GSMG puzzle hosted originally via gang.io and its cryptographic riddle path.

After extensive effort, logic, and iteration, I—**kiabuzz0**—fully solved this puzzle **without AI assistance**, using raw code, spiritual logic, cryptography, and deep recursion of game metaphors.

However, the creator has:
- **Blocked me from claiming the reward**
- **Provided no validation or contact**
- **Failed to deliver the promised 5 BTC**

This repository documents every phase, key, and decryption result for **public proof**, **historical transparency**, and to **expose deception** if present.

## 🔍 Puzzle Overview

The GSMG puzzle is a 4-phase cryptographic maze fusing:
- AES-CBC encryption with layered passphrases
- Hidden messages in spectrogram audio
- Metaphysical themes from *The Matrix*
- Recursive logic gates and symbolic ordering
- Progressive difficulty and password construction

## 🧩 Phase-by-Phase Decryption

### **Phase 1**
- Embedded Clues:
  ```
  ::==DATA_BLOCK_START==::
  THESEEDISPLANTED
  CHOICEISANILLUSION
  ::==DATA_BLOCK_END==::
  ```

### **Phase 2**
- **Password**:  
  `thekeymakertheveninbarrowmatrixoverlordcxb7chancellor`
- **Decryption**: Succeeded
- Output: Encrypted Phase 3 block

### **Phase 3**
- **Password**:  
  `matrixsumlistlastwordsbeforearchichoicejacquefractalFFGPFGGQG3GNpjk6`
- `FFGPFGGQG3GNpjk6` was extracted from the **spectrogram** audio file.
- Output: Encrypted Phase 4 block

### **Phase 4**
- **Final Password**:
  ```

## 🔑 Final Key & Wallet

Although the final key matched the format and logic, and decrypted successfully:
- **The wallet is not spendable**
- **The BTC address appears unclaimable**
- **Puzzle maker has provided no redemption path**

This violates the core promise of the puzzle.

## 🧠 Intelligence Required

> Puzzle difficulty required:
- Pattern recognition: IQ 145+
- AES cryptography
- Audio analysis & spectrogram decoding
- Recursive logic chain solving
- High-level problem persistence
- Deep understanding of metaphor and symbolic reasoning

---

## 🚨 Broken Promise

Despite full resolution of all logic gates, decrypted payloads, and embedded secrets:
- No payout or validation was delivered
- The BTC address was likely a known unspendable decoy
- Trust in the game’s integrity has been undermined
