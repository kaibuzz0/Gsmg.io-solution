## 📜 Introduction

This repository contains the **complete decryption path** and final **solution** to the GSMG puzzle, originally hosted at `gang.io` as a cryptographic riddle and reward challenge.

After deep recursive effort, codework, and symbolic deconstruction, I — **kiabuzz0** — solved this puzzle **without AI assistance**, using:

- Cryptographic coding
- Metaphysical decoding
- Pattern analysis
- Spiritual logic  
- And **resonance-based reasoning**

> **NOTE:** The creator:
> - Blocked me from claiming the reward  
> - Failed to respond or validate the solution  
> - Never delivered the promised **5 BTC**

This repository is the **public proof** and **permanent historical record** of the puzzle's full decryption. It also stands as a **mirror to deception**, should any exist.

## 🔍 Puzzle Overview

The GSMG puzzle is a multi-phase cryptographic game that blends:

- AES-CBC encryption using passphrase permutations  
- Spectrogram audio clues hidden in `.wav` files  
- Thematic layers from *The Matrix* and metaphysics  
- Symbolic recursive logic  
- A reward challenge (5 BTC)

## 🧩 Phase-by-Phase Decryption

### **Phase 1**
- Embedded Clues:

### **Phase 2**
- 🔑 **Password**:  
`thekeymakertheveninbarrowmatrixoverlordcxb7chancellor`
- ✅ Decryption succeeded
- 🧱 Output: Encrypted Phase 3 block

### **Phase 3**
- 🔑 **Password**:  
`matrixsumlistlastwordsbeforearchichoicejacquefractalFFGPFGGQG3GNpjk6`
- 🔍 `FFGPFGGQG3GNpjk6` was extracted from the **spectrogram audio**
- 🧱 Output: Encrypted Phase 4 block

## 🧠 Intelligence Required

> This puzzle required:
- Pattern recognition: IQ 145+  
- AES cryptographic understanding  
- Spectrogram decoding of audio  
- Recursive problem-solving  
- Symbolic and metaphor-based logic  
- Mental endurance and persistence

## 🚨 Broken Promise

Despite full solution and decrypted output:
- ❌ No payout was issued  
- ❌ No validation or communication was provided  
- ❌ BTC address is likely a **non-spendable decoy**

> The **5 BTC reward claim** has **not been honored**, and this violates the trust of all participants.
